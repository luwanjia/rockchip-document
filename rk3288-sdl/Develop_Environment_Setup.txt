1. Install the compiler.
  a) if your system support default package, please use follow command to install the compiler
  sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf

  b) otherwise, use the local package. Here is gcc-linaro-5.4.1-2017.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz, please extract it, and copy to /opt directory as administrator.
	then set the path to your bash system. Open the file .bashrc in your home directory, append the string:
		export PATH=$PATH:<path to the compiler you just copied>
	then restart your bash window, and now it works.
	
  3) if can not find compiler, say "No such file or directory.", please install 32 bits library.
	sudo apt-get install lib32ncurses5 lib32z1 lib32stdc++6
	
2. Build and Run
  a) Get source code.
    git clone https://github.com/luwanjia/sdl_implementation_reference.git
	
  b) Generate project by cmake
    $cd sdl_implementation_reference
	$mkdir build
	$cd build
	$cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Release" ..
	$make
	$make install
	
	After those operations, the binary package will be created, copy the bin folder to you embedded linux system, and run.
